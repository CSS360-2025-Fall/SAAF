User Story 1: Require Authentication for Private Discord Games

As a Discord user who wants to host or join a private game, I want the bot to make sure that only invited or authorized players can access private sessions, so that my game data and conversations stay secure and I don’t have to worry about strangers joining. The bot should check users’ Discord IDs or server roles before letting them in, and politely block anyone who isn’t authorized with a clear message. At the same time, any logs the bot creates shouldn’t include personal information like tokens or private messages, keeping everything safe and compliant with Discord’s data rules. This way, players can trust that private games really are private, and the server stays secure from unwanted interruptions or bad actors.


User Story 2: Rate Limiting and Safe Logging 

As a Discord user, I want the bot to limit how often I can send commands like /play so that the server stays stable and the game doesn’t crash, even if a lot of people are playing at once. I also want the bot to handle this politely, letting me know when I need to wait instead of just failing silently. I want any information the bot records about my activity to be safe and anonymous, so my personal messages or account info aren’t exposed. This way, I can play without disruptions, feel treated fairly, and trust that my data is protected while enjoying the game with others.
